This is compilation of code used for simulation and for generating figures in the paper: **Echo statistics associated with discrete scatterers: A tutorial on physics-based methods**. The authors of this paper are [Timothy K. Stanton](mailto:tstanton@whoi.edu) (@timstanton99), [Wu-Jung Lee](mailto:wjlee@apl.washington.edu) (@leewujung), and [Kyungmin Baik](mailto:kbaik@kriss.re.kr) (@nupho27). @leewujung and @nupho27 jointly contribute to this repository. The paper is being re-submitted after review and a PDF copy will be uploaded here once accepted.

The code are written in Matlab and many of them involve using the parallel computing toolbox to speed up Monte Carlo simulation.
