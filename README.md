This is compilation of code used for simulation and for generating figures in the paper:
**Echo statistics associated with discrete scatterers: A tutorial on physics-based methods**. The authors of this paper are [Timothy K. Stanton](mailto:tstanton@whoi.edu) (@timstanton99), [Wu-Jung Lee](mailto:wjlee@apl.washington.edu) (@leewujung), and [Kyungmin Baik](mailto:kbaik@kriss.re.kr). Stanton is the primary author of the tutorial, and Lee and Baik contributed equally to the discussion of the tutorial content and producing all figures. The paper is currently under review and will be uploaded here once accepted.

The code are written in Matlab and many of them involve using the parallel computing toolbox to speed up Monte Carlo simulation.
