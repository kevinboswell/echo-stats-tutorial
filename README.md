This is compilation of code used for simulation and for generating figures in the paper:
**Echo statistics associated with discrete scatterers: A tutorial on physics-based methods**. The authors of this paper are [Timothy K. Stanton](mailto:tstanton@whoi.edu) (@timstanton99), [Wu-Jung Lee](mailto:wjlee@apl.washington.edu) (@leewujung), and [Kyungmin Baik](mailto:kbaik@kriss.re.kr). All authors jointly contribute to this repository. The paper is currently under review and will be uploaded here once accepted.

The code are written in Matlab and many of them involve using the parallel computing toolbox to speed up Monte Carlo simulation.
